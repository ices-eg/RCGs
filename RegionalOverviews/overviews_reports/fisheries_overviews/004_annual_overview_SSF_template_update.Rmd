**Disclaimer**

The tables and figures of the overviews presented in this document are made for the coordination of EU regional fisheries data collection purposes and are not designed for any other use. Data used for producing the outputs are extracted from the Regional Database (RDB) and EU Fleet Register. Dates of data extractions are stated in Appendix A. Due to different aggregations and reporting authorities, data can differ from those used e.g. for assessments or technical reports.
Member States (MS) are responsible for uploading latest data and the latest year should be viewed as provisional. Data can be resubmitted by a MS for more than one previous year so there might be differences in earlier year reports, if countries update back in time. Responsibility for the quality of the data and comparability to other data sources lies with the MS that provided these data. The upload logs presented by MS regarding the data submitted to RDB can be found in the ISSG Data Quality report.

The respective scripts and calculations used for data displaying are publicly available via the RCG GitHub (https://github.com/ices-eg/RCGs) and subject to change as the work of the group progresses. 


# Introduction

The present Catch and Effort Overview displays summary information on the EU commercial landings (CL) and commercial effort (CE) statistics included in the Regional Data Base (RDB), which is used to store detailed commercial fisheries and sampling data.

Before the subgroup on catch, effort and sampling overviews was set up, the different RCGs conducted data analysis and overviews separately with minimal exchange, resulting in redundancies and efficiency loss. Furthermore, a substantial part of the work was being carried out during the RCG meetings themselves and so not readily available to inform RCG preparation and meeting discussions. This group was established to streamline and facilitate the work on the fisheries and sampling data of the MS and prepare data overviews in advance of the RCG meetings.

The RDB is hosted at the International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and its data is property of EU Member States with usage governed by the RDB data policy (https://www.ices.dk/data/Documents/Data_Policy_RDB.pdf). It is a regionally coordinated database platform covering fisheries by region (e.g. North Atlantic Ocean, North Sea, Baltic Sea) and is a main resource used by the Regional Coordination Groups to coordinate data collection of EU fisheries. This database aims also: 1) To ensure that data can be made available for the coordination of regional fisheries data sampling plans, in particular for the DCF Regional Coordination Groups (RCGs); 2) To provide a regional estimation system such that statistical estimates of quantities of interest can be produced from sample data, in order to deliver data for ICES stock assessments and advice, 3) To serve and facilitate the production of fisheries management advice and status reports, 4) To increase the awareness of fisheries data collected by the users of the RDB and the overall usage of these data. 5) Addresses fishery management needs related to the European Union Common Fisheries

However, it has been recognized for many years that there is a need to have a new version of the RDB which would also store details about how the sampling was performed and enable statistical estimations to be made.

In fact, the current Regional Data Base stores the commercial catch and sample data at detailed level, and here the data format and estimations do not support statistical estimations, even though most of the countries’ sampling are not done in a statistical way, the countries never used the RDB for raising/estimating their data. The countries have raised/estimated the data nationally at the institutes and uploaded the data to InterCatch for the stock assessment Expert Groups. That means the stock assessment EG have no information of how the data have been raised/estimated until the data is uploaded into InterCatch, from that point and through the international raising the data and processes are fully documented. InterCatch does neither support statistical estimations. 
The incoming "Regional DataBase and Estimation System" (RDBES) is taking the place of the RDB (and InterCatch) to improve those aspects. It is expected that RDBES will fill the gaps of the RDB and, in the near future, will also allow the improvement of the information reported in these fisheries overviews.


## Reading the graphs
### Barplots

In the (bar)plots displayed, the subtitles also give the indication of the completeness of the RDB information presented because some data cannot be displayed in the plots (e.g. due to missing or incorrect values or due to missing referring data). For example, if no statistical rectangle is given or the harbour names are missing, landings in the respective plots can’t be displayed.
The factor x:% in subtitle indicates the percentage of RDB data that is displayed in the x-variable. y:% in subtitle indicates the percentage of RDB data in the respective y-variable. z:% in subtitle indicate the percentage of completeness (i.e., non-missing) RDB rows in variable. 

### Maps

The maps are generated based on complete and available data from the RDB. The subtitles of the header refer to the sub-selection that is displayed (e.g. “all Data”, “pelagics”, etc.).  If the data cannot be shown on a map (e.g. due to missing information on the area or harbour code), the missing values are given in the figure text below.
