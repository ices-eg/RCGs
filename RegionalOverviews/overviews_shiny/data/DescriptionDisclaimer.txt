<font size="2">Tables, plots and graphs presented in this document and overviews are made for the coordination purposes of regional 
fisheries data collection and are not designed for any other use. Data used for the outputs are extracted from the Regional Database 
(RDB) and European Fleet Register. Due to different aggregations and reporting authorities, data can differ to those, e.g., used for assessments or 
technical reports. Member States (MS) are responsible for uploading latest data and the latest year should be viewed as provisional. Data can be 
resubmitted by a MS for more than one previous year so there might be differences in earlier year reports if countries update back 
in time. Responsibility for the quality of the data and comparability to other data sources lies with the MS that provided these data. The respective 
scripts and calculations used for data displaying are publicly available via the RCG GitHub <a href="https://github.com/ices-eg/RCGs"> RCGs GitHub </a> 
and subject to change as the work of the group progresses.</font>
